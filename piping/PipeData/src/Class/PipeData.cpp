// Filename:    PipeData.cpp
//
// Purpose:     This is the class implementation file that defines all the member functions of the class
//              1. The constructor creates an instance of the class and initializes the class member variables to blank/zero
//              2. Public Member Function/method 'void GetUserInput()' does the following
//                  2.1 Calls private member function 
//                      this->nom_size = get_str_from_user(msg...)
//                      returns size entered by user to the private member variable 'nom_size'
//
//                  2.2 Calls private member function again
//                      this->sched = get_str_from_user(msg...)
//                      returns size entered by user to the private member variable 'sched'
//
//                  2.3 Private member function is called which gets the OD and Thickness 
//                      int result = get_od_and_thk();
//                      the result is to capture any error messages
//                      Portions of two dimensional string array pipAry[][16] are read into map objects to find the matching Size and Schedule index
//                      The following private member variables are then set based on the index values returned by the map with size/sched
//                          this->pipeOD = std::stod(pipAry[size_index][1]);
//                          this->pipeThk = std::stod(pipAry[size_index][sch_index]);
//
//                  2.4 Private member function is called to print any errors if not = SUCCESS print_any_errors(result);
//
//                  2.5 Private member function 'get_addn_data()' is called which calculates and sets the following private class member variables
//                          this->pipeID 
//                          this->emptyWtPerFt
//                          this->waterWtPerFt
//                          this->pipeWtFullPerFt
//
//              3. Public member Funciton 'PrintPipeData()' Prints the values of the private member variables which are set by getter Functions / calculated
